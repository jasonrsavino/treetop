# Contributing to Treetop
If you'd like to contribute to Treetop, please do so! There is always a lot of ground to cover and something for your wheelhouse.

No pull request is too small. Check out any [up for grabs issues](https://github.com/jasonrsavino/treetop/labels/help%20wanted%20-%20up%20for%20grabs) as a starting point.

## Guidelines
1. Please keep your pull requests concise and limited to **ONE** change at a time. This makes reviewing and testing so much easier.
2. _ALWAYS_ submit pull requests against the [dev branch](https://github.com/jasonrsavino/treetop/tree/dev).

##Coding style
Two files combine within the project to define and maintain our coding style.

* The `.editorconfig` controls spaces / tabs within supported editors. Check out their [site](http://editorconfig.org/).
* The `.eslintrc` defines our javascript standards. Some editors will evaluate this real-time - otherwise it's run using `grunt|gulp build`
